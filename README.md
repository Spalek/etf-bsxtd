The test driver is loaded by the etf framework at runtime. The test driver
loads the test data into the integrated [BaseX database](http://basex.org/) and
executes XQuery data test scripts bundled as ETF project files.

The project can be build and installed by running the gradlew.sh/.bat wrapper with:
```gradle
$ gradlew build install
```
